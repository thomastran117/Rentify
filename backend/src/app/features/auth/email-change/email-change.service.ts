/**
 * Moving an account to a new email address.
 *
 * The address is the account's primary identifier and its recovery channel, so
 * the flow demands two independent proofs. Starting a request needs a recent MFA
 * step-up, enforced by the controller; finishing one needs a code delivered to
 * the new address, enforced here. The first proves the session belongs to the
 * account holder, the second proves the account holder can actually receive mail
 * at the address they typed — without which a typo would silently lock them out.
 *
 * Only `requestChange` is MFA-gated. `confirmChange` deliberately is not, and
 * cannot be: the MFA proof cache stamps every proof with a hash over the user's
 * email and token version, so the write this method performs invalidates the
 * caller's own proof. Requiring one here would also strand any user whose
 * fifteen-minute proof lapsed while they fetched the code from another inbox.
 * The pending record is only creatable behind the gate, which is what carries
 * the guarantee forward to this step.
